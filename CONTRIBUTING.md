## To run the application in development

### Step 1 👍 : to setup JHipster locally 

`git clone https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster`

`cd generator-jhipster`

`npm install | yarn`

`npm link | yarn link`

( 🏁 Kudos, you just setup JHipster and linked to it locally )

### Step 2 ✌️ : to setup JHipster-Kotlin generator 

`git clone https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin`

`cd jhipster-kotlin`

`npm install | yarn`

`npm link | yarn link`

`npm link generator-jhipster | yarn link generator-jhipster`

( 🏁 Kudos, you just setup JHipster-Kotlin and linked to it locally )
( 📝 Note: you are linking the JHipster to JHipster-Kotlin with the final command)

### Step 3 🤟 : before generating your application, go to your application folder 

`yarn link "generator-jhipster" && yarn link "generator-jhipster-kotlin"`

or

`npm link "generator-jhipster" && npm link "generator-jhipster-kotlin"`

( 🏁 Kudos, you have done it. It is the time to generate the application `jhipster --blueprint kotlin` )

✨✨✨✨ You are rocking ✨✨✨✨
